# ArithmeticGame
Run the main class and follow the directions
on the screen.

The division questions utilize integer division, so
do not attempt to enter in a number with 
any decimal points. 4 / 5 = 0, for example, 
not .8.

The program relies on two .txt files to store info.
history.txt stores the users immediate history,
such as their answers to certain questions. It is 
reset automatically. However, the leaderboard.txt 
file is not by design. Should you run 
into any problems with the leaderboard 
(which you will almost certainly not), 
try manually resetting the information within 
leaderboard.txt.
